            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                &emsp; Founded in 2010 by a group of passionate adventurers and seasoned river guides, Turbo Rafting 
                Extraordinaires was born out of a shared love for white water rafting and the thrill of conquering some 
                of the most challenging rapids in the world. What started as a small, local operation quickly gained a 
                reputation for offering high-energy, exhilarating rafting experiences that catered to thrill-seekers and 
                nature enthusiasts alike.
            </p>
            <p class="p2">
                &emsp; With a focus on safety, fun, and exceptional service, Turbo Rafting Extraordinaires grew rapidly, 
                attracting adventurers from all over. The company's unique approach combined top-tier equipment, expert 
                guides, and a relentless commitment to making each trip a memorable adventure. As their reputation for 
                excellence spread, so did their reach, with the company expanding to offer guided trips on some of the 
                most iconic and adrenaline-pumping rivers.
            </p>
            <p class="p3">
                &emsp; Today, Turbo Rafting Extraordinaires is known not only for its thrilling white water experiences but
